# Course Description

High-throughput 'omics studies generate ever larger datasets and, as a consequence, complex data interpretation challenges. This course focusses on statistical concepts involved in preprocessing, quantification, normalization, visualization, integration and differential analysis of single-cell 'omics data. The course will rely exclusively on free and user-friendly open-source tools in R/Bioconductor. We hope that this will provide a solid basis for beginners, but will also bring new perspectives to those already familiar with standard data analysis workflows for proteomics and next-generation sequencing applications.

# Prerequisites

The prerequisites  are the successful completion of a basic course of statistics that covers topics on data exploration and descriptive statistics, statistical modeling, and inference: linear models, confidence intervals, t-tests, F-tests, anova, chi-squared test.
The basis concepts may be revisited in the online course at https://gtpb.github.io/PSLS20/ (English) and in https://statomics.github.io/statistiekCursusNotas/ (Dutch).

In addition, knowledge of programming in `R` is preferred. A primer to `R` and Data visualization in `R` can be found at:

 - `R` Basics: https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/335/
 - `R` Data Exploration: https://dodona.ugent.be/nl/courses/345/


# Software 

- Participants are required to bring their own laptop with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.1.1 or greater. 

- We also recommend to also install the latest version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

- Participants who have issues with the installation of the R/Rstudio can use an Rstudio instance in the cloud with all packages installed for the course in the mean time. Note, that this is instance is not for routine use.
